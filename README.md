- Welcome! My name is Daniel Burrall
- I'm interested in one day becoming a full stack dev, capable programming in any and all languages! 
- I'm currently working on front end mark up languages and codes including:HTML5, java, & CSS, I know c++ and just a little bit of python currently.
- As of right now, I practice building websites while taking on "The Odin Project" to learn all aspects to being a software dev.
